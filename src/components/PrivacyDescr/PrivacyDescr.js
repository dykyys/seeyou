          SSEEYOU provide a powerful set of tools to enhance your communication
          in real time. Our free personal conference library enables you to
          store all the conferences that you have participated in including your
          time-stamped notes. Thus, creating a powerful tool for further
          communication. Sharing of conference videos raise issues related to
          Data Protection and more specifically breach of the individual
          participants consent. SEEYOU encourage the user not to share videos
          from conferences recorded via SEEYOU without consent from the other
          participants due to potential breach of Data Protection rules.
