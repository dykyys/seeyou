              <Questions>Is recording and storing conferences legal?</Questions>
              <Answer>
                SEEYOU is EU-based. According to GDPR, you may only record and
                store conferences for personal use. Please consult your
                applicable laws and regulations if recording and storing
                conferences outside of the EU/EEA

              <Questions>
                Can I record when using SEEYOU on my mobile phone?
              </Questions>
              <Answer>
                No, limitations to the operating systems on iOS and Android
                prevents recordings on mobile phones. So, for now, this is a
                desktop feature only

              </Questions>
              <Answer>
                No, the same problem as with recordings. So, for now, this is a
                desktop feature only

                How does the hyper-link on the sticky notes work?
              </Questions>
              <Answer>
                Simple, if you open SEEYOU and click on any note taken during a
                conference you have stored, the conference opens where you
                started taking the note. Kind of cool when preparing for an
                exam, a meeting, or whatever

              <Questions>
                Are the chat and video messages end-to-end encrypted?
              </Questions>
              <Answer>
                Yes, they are. SEEYOU's chat, video, and voice calls are
                end-to-end encrypted, meaning they're genuinely private. SEEYOU
                cannot read the content nor see with whom you are communicating.
                Nor can anyone else
              </Answer>
              <Answer>
                Unlike many other providers, this holds for group chats too. The
                encryption key is personal and managed by your mobile phone, and
                logs are not centrally stored by SEEYOU but are yours alone

                Why must I download SEEYOU both on desktop and mobile?
              </Questions>
              <Answer>
                Because your mobile phone store your personal end-to-end
                encryption key, making your communication truly private
